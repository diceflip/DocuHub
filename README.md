## 🎯 What is DocuHub?

DocuHub is a **comprehensive, browser-based document toolkit** that performs all processing locally using WebAssembly. Built with TypeScript in a single, unified repository, it handles PDFs, document conversions, data transformations, and OCR—**entirely offline**.

### 🛑 The Problem We Solve

Most document tools require uploading sensitive files to unknown servers. DocuHub eliminates this privacy risk by processing everything in your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

### Why DocuHub?

✅ **100% Privacy** – All processing happens locally in your browser  
✅ **Truly Offline** – Works without internet after first load (PWA)  
✅ **Fast** – WebAssembly engines deliver near-native performance  
✅ **Free & Open Source** – No subscriptions, no hidden costs  
✅ **Developer-Friendly** – Clean TypeScript, modular architecture  
✅ **Single Repository** – Easy to contribute, easy to maintain  

---
## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Workflow
- DocuHub follows a maintainer-approved contribution process.
- Browse existing issues and pick one.
- If you have a new idea or bug report, open an issue first.
- Wait for maintainer approval before starting work.
- Once approved and labeled, you may begin development.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description.

Unapproved pull requests may be closed to maintain code quality.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get **DocuHub** up and running locally in just a few minutes.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** `v18+`
* **Package manager**: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` (recommended)
* A **modern web browser** with **WebAssembly (WASM)** support

> 💡 Tip: Check your Node version using `node -v`

---

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run DocuHub locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/R3ACTR/DocuHub.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd DocuHub

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

---

### 🌐 Run the App

Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see **DocuHub** running locally 🎉

---

### 🛠️ Alternative Package Managers

If you prefer `npm` or `yarn`, you can use:

```bash
# npm
npm install
npm run dev

# yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
```

---
### Build for Production
```bash
# Create optimized production build
pnpm run build

# Preview production build
pnpm run preview
```
---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Privacy First** – No data leaves the browser
2. **Offline Capable** – Full functionality without internet
3. **Performance** – WebAssembly for heavy lifting
4. **Modularity** – Clear separation of concerns
5. **Type Safety** – Strict TypeScript throughout

### WebAssembly Engines

DocuHub leverages three WASM engines:

- **pdf-engine** – PDF manipulation (based on pdf-lib + PDF.js)
- **image-engine** – Image processing (Sharp compiled to WASM)
- **ocr-engine** – Text recognition (Tesseract.js)

All engines run in Web Workers to keep the UI responsive.

## 🛠️ Tech Deep Dive

### How Offline Processing Works

1. **Service Worker** caches the entire app on first load
2. **WebAssembly modules** loaded into memory
3. **File operations** use FileReader API (no uploads)
4. **Processing** happens in Web Workers (non-blocking)
5. **Results** saved to IndexedDB or downloaded directly

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | File Size | Time |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| PDF Merge (10 files) | 50 MB | ~2.3s |
| Image → PDF (batch 20) | 30 MB | ~1.8s |
| OCR (300 DPI scan) | 5 MB | ~4.5s |
| JSON → Excel (100k rows) | 10 MB | ~0.9s |

*Tested on: M1 Mac, Chrome 120*

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Our Promises

1. **No Data Collection** – We don't see or store your files
2. **No Third-Party Services** – No external APIs called
3. **No Tracking** – No analytics, no cookies
4. **Open Source** – Audit our code anytime
5. **Local Storage Only** – You control what's cached

### Security Best Practices

- Files processed in isolated Web Workers
- Memory cleared after operations
- No persistent storage without user consent
- Service Worker can be manually cleared
